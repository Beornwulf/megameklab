Note that not everything has been implemented across the suite at this time, which will lead to gaps.

## RUNNING MEGAMEKLAB

Java programs run in their own environment, called a Virtual Machine or VM for short. These Java VMs are available on
most systems from a variety of sources.

Windows users: To start MegaMekLab, run the MegaMekLab.exe file. If this fails to start MegaMekLab, see the "INSTALLING
OR UPDATING YOUR JAVA RUNTIME" section, below.

Other graphical OSes: Many other graphical OSes, such as macOS, will allow you to double-click the .jar file to run it.
If this does not work, try running MegaMek from the command line.

Running MegaMekLab from the command line: To do this using Sun Java, or most other implementations, navigate to the
directory containing the .jar file and run: `java -jar MegaMekLab.jar`.

If none of the above options work for you, see the "INSTALLING OR UPDATING YOUR JAVA RUNTIME" section, below.

### INSTALLING OR UPDATING YOUR JAVA RUNTIME

Of the versions available, we now require Java 17 LTS as the bare minimal version. Newer versions should work but are
not currently supported.

#### Adoptium (Windows)

For Windows, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Updating-to-Adoptium) to ensure Java
is installed correctly for the most seamless experience.

#### Adoptium (Mac)

For Mac, download the installer
from [Adoptium]( https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&version=17&arch=aarch64&package=jre) directly for your
version of macOS and underling platform (AARCH64 is for M-Series Mac's).

#### Linux

For Linux, your distribution should have a version of Java available via your package manager.

## CUSTOM UNITS

All units (meks, vehicles, infantry, etc.) are located in the data/mekfiles directory. They may be individual files or
zipped up into archives (".zip"), and you may also create subdirectories if you like.

We recommend creating a folder called Customs in the data/mekfiles directory. Then using this folder to store all custom
units.

As of 0.49.13, We've removed the unsupported and unofficial folders. Over the years the unsupported units dropped to
only a couple. The unofficial folder is available
from [the Extras repository](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek-extras).

### Note of file types

MegaMekLab uses two file types for units. Files with the extension MTF are meks, and all other unit types are BLK files.
Both are editable with a quality text editor, but we recommend not hand editing files as it can break the programs.

## Compiling

1) Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

2) Follow the [instructions on the wiki](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/Working-With-Gradle) for using Gradle.

### Style Guide

When contributing to this project, please enable the EditorConfig option within your IDE to ensure some basic compliance
with our [style guide](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/wiki/MegaMek-Coding-Style-Guide) which includes some defaults
for line length, tabs vs. spaces, etc. When all else fails, we follow
the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
